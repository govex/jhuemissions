      <h2>
        What are carbon emissions and how are they created?   
      </h2>
      <p>
        Carbon emissions occur when carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are discharged into the air through burning fossil fuels like oil, for instance, from an airplane engine.
      </p>
      <h2>
        How do we measure them? (carbon footprint, metric tonne)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Carbon emissions are typically measured in mass, for instance, by metric tons (tonnes). 1 tonne of CO2 weighs as much as a small car. When speaking of greenhouse gas emissions, 1 tonne is equivalent to the amount of warming created by driving a gas-powered car for 5,000 miles.

        Air Travel to other travel modes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Transportation accounts for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest single source of carbon pollution and one that's rapidly growing. Passenger cars make up over half of these emissions. Deciding how to travel most efficiently often depends on how far a traveler is going. For short trips, flying will generally be much more carbon intensive. Carbon pollution emitted to travel one km is much greater for domestic flights when compared to gas-powered cars (246 g versus 170g). A bus trip or rail journey of the same distance emits just 97g and 35g respectively. As such, taking transit is by far the lowest carbon way to travel, where possible... that is, if you can't walk or bike (<a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fourworldindata.org%2Fgrapher%2Fcarbon-footprint-travel-mode&data=05%7C02%7Csbertran%40jhu.edu%7Ca810d4516e1e4abe15a108dd667e49fd%7C9fa4f438b1e6473b803f86f8aedf0dec%7C0%7C0%7C638779414838637733%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=9%2FP8PmGOi2OfMGGPS8t6RzzLhSQyy9486s7TWqSEBlU%3D&reserved=0">source</a>)

        Air Travel to other travel-related activities
      </h2>
      <p>
        Emissions from air travel will typically represent over 90% of all emissions produced in a work trip, with hotel accommodations representing about 7% and ground travel, such as taxis, under 1% (<a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsustainable.stanford.edu%2Fsites%2Fg%2Ffiles%2Fsbiybj26701%2Ffiles%2Fmedia%2Ffile%2Fscope-3-emissions-from-business-travel_public-march-2023.pdf&data=05%7C02%7Csbertran%40jhu.edu%7Ca810d4516e1e4abe15a108dd667e49fd%7C9fa4f438b1e6473b803f86f8aedf0dec%7C0%7C0%7C638779414838660019%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2BnOINOVtot9ucajwqowAQws6qaGIqdydBji14eWJMTY%3D&reserved=0">source</a>).

        What affects air travel emissions?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Air itineraries can have enormous variations in emissions. The most important factors are the number of stops, aircraft class, and carrier choice. <a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheicct.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fpublications%2Fvariation-aviation-emissions-itinerary-jul2021-1.pdf&data=05%7C02%7Csbertran%40jhu.edu%7Ca810d4516e1e4abe15a108dd667e49fd%7C9fa4f438b1e6473b803f86f8aedf0dec%7C0%7C0%7C638779414838678766%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=8xYJ7LLr54DFxLDUNP%2B%2FGZ9JpnBuKpLZYYGvXLtzUvE%3D&reserved=0">Read more here.</a>
